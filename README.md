# ConcordatoFacile Redirect

This repository provides a simple HTML-based solution to redirect users to the ConcordatoFacile website.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to take advantage of GitHub Pages to seamlessly direct visitors from the `concordatofacile.github.io` page to the main ConcordatoFacile site hosted on another platform.

## How it Works

The `index.html` file uses a meta refresh tag to automatically redirect users to the correct website.

## Note

This redirection happens on the client side, meaning the browser's address bar will update to reflect the new URL after the redirect.

For more information, please visit the main ConcordatoFacile website.
