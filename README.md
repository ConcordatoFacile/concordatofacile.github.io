# ConcordatoFacile Redirect

This repository contains a simple HTML redirect to the ConcordatoFacile website.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to utilize the GitHub Pages feature to redirect visitors from `concordatofacile.github.io` to the main ConcordatoFacile website hosted on Carrd.co.

## How it works

The `index.html` file in this repository contains a meta refresh tag that automatically redirects visitors to `https://concordatofacile.carrd.co`.

## Note

This is a client-side redirect. The URL in the visitor's browser will change to `https://concordatofacile.carrd.co` after the redirect occurs.
